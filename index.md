# Bio

@@row
I’m Jamison Sloan, a PhD student affiliated with the ~~~<a href=" http://www.rle.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Research Lab of Electronics (RLE)</a>~~~
at MIT. Prior to this, I was an undergrad in the MIT Physics department, so I’ve been in Boston for as long as I’ve been paying taxes. My research has been conducted in the ~~~<a href="" target="_blank">Modern Electromagnetics group</a> ~~~of ~~~<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~soljacic/marin.html" target="_blank">Prof. Marin Soljacic</a>~~~, and has also been supported by collaborations with John D. Joannopoulos (MIT), and Ido Kaminer (Technion). I was previously supported by the National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship, as well as a Mathworks fellowship.
