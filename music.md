# Music

I was classically trained in piano growing up. After that, I went rogue, and have spent the past few years moonlighting as a jazz pianist. During this time, I have been taught by Mike Garson, Yoko Miwa, and Miguel Zenon. At MIT, I have participated in Chamber Music Society Jazz combos, as well as the Emerson Harris Fellowship program.
