# Music

I was classically trained in piano growing up. After that, I went rogue, and have spent the past few years moonlighting as a jazz pianist. During this time, I have been taught by [Mike Garson](https://mikegarson.com/), [Yoko Miwa](http://www.yokomiwa.com/), and [Miguel Zen√≥n](https://miguelzenon.com/). At MIT, I have participated in Chamber Music Society Jazz combos, as well as the [Emerson Harris Fellowship](https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study) program.
