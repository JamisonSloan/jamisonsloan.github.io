# Research

<!-- \toc -->

Some key questions that guide my research are:

- How can new degrees of freedom (like time) be used to control the flow of light?
- How can strongly driven systems be used to create new light sources?
- How can novel nonlinear systems be used to control over the quantum properties of light?
