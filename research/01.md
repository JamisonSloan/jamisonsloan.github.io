# Optics in strongly driven systems
One of my main research interests is the behavior of light in systems which are strongly driven in time by some external field. This concept encompasses a wide array of physical systems which fall under a variety of different subfields in physics. Some examples include:

- Strongly driven gases which exhibit high harmonic generation (HHG)
- Strongly driven qubits, spins, or atoms which can be used to create Floquet states
- Strongly driven epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials which can exhibit order unity changes in the refractive index over femtosecond timescales

Within this domain, I have specifically focused on two main topics:

1. The general description of electromganetic response when strong time dependence is present in addition to dispersion
2. The generation of entangled photon pairs from time dependent systems

Systems with a strong time dependence are famous for their ability to convert electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations into entangled pairs of photons. This phenomenon appears under many different guises across a wide range of topics. In optics, this appears in the form of nonlinear processes like spontaneous parametric down conversion or four-wave mixing. In systems with moving boundaries, this appears in the form of the so-called “dynamical Casimir effect.” In cosmology, it takes the form of Unruh radiation from acceleration, and Hawking radiation from black holes.
